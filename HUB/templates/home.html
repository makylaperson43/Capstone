        I went to The Hub Bistro today for the first time. The food and coffee
        was delicious but the visit with the precious owners is what made the
        experience great. You should go support this young family. I can't eat
        them but those pastries looked AMAZING! Eat more for me.

          The Hub Bistro is a wonderful place for breakfast and lunch! Their
          coffee is absolutely delicious and they offer a sugar free option for
          every coffee flavor. Their cinnamon roll is one of the best I've ever
          had. The service is friendly and warm and extremely accommodating. I
          don't know the owner personally, but just from the handful of times
          I've met and spoken with her, I can tell she is a very special person.
          Just precious! If you're in Water Valley and don't make a stop here,
          you're sorely missing out.

          Food is so good! Soup yesterday was AMAZING! Had greek salad today,
          just as good. Breakfast was also yummy! Would definitely recommend!
