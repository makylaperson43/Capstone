        I went to The Hub Bistro today for the first time. The food and coffee
        was delicious but the visit with the precious owners is what made the
        experience great. You should go support this young family. I can't eat
        them but those pastries looked AMAZING! Eat more for me.

        The Hub Bistro is a wonderful place for breakfast and lunch! Their
        coffee is absolutely delicious and they offer a sugar free option for
        every coffee flavor. Their cinnamon roll is one of the best I've ever
        had. The service is friendly and warm and extremely accommodating. I
        don't know the owner personally, but just from the handful of times I've
        met and spoken with her, I can tell she is a very special person. Just
        precious! If you're in Water Valley and don't make a stop here, you're
        sorely missing out.
